All Natural, Non-Laser Tattoo Removal using Tattoo Vanish(r) Method.

Do you or someone you know have an unwanted tattoo?

Have you been hesitant to have it removed because of the pain and price of traditional methods of removing tattoos?

Here is a brief overview of the Tattoo Vanish Method.

There are no color restrictions with this method. It brings ALL colors of ink up and out of the body.

It requires less sessions than traditional laser as it removes ALL colors and more ink with each procedure performed.

This method costs less money as it may not require as many procedures as other methods of removal.

The method is result oriented as it "lifts" the ink out of the body and into a controlled scab which forms through the body's natural healing process.

The procedure is performed with a machine similar to what was used to receive the tattoo.

There is less pain associated with the procedure as an anesthetic is used before and during the treatment for the client's comfort.

It is the safest method as it is the first, ALL NATURAL product and procedure.
